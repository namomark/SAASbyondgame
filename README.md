# SAASbyondgame
The game that people at SAAS are making using BYOND

#Contact me to become a collaborator so you can merge and stuff
#Here's the Github format we are going to use:
#Make a personal fork to your github account
#Clone the repo from there
#Push from local to your personal fork, use branches if you want to but it wont be required
#Make a pull request
#A collaborator will check the code and merge the branch
#As a general convention, whenever adding content, just make a new file and we can figure out reducing files later
#Make folders to your own porogative
